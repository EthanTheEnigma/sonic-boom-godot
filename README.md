# Sonic Boom, a godot 4 fangame engine
A sonic fangame engine for godot 4, in very rough early stages but the movement system is mostly complete if a bit buggy. Uses a combination of original sonic-style movement with boost-style movement and uses a crude simulation of aerodynamic drag, but you can change it to suit your needs. Since this project is very early, there may be drastic changes in various systems and code architecture as the project's needs become more clear, but it *is* usable for making basic games if you're willing to do some of the work of implementing menus, health/rings, and menus/gamestate yourself. Those latter features will come in time as the project progresses, this initial version is mostly the movement system and a small test level for it.
